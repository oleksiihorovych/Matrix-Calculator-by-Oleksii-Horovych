## Technologies Used

-   **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: Provides the user interface for the application,
	- XAML for layout and C# for backend logic.
-   **C# Library**:
	-  Custom C# library (MatrixCalc) was written. Includes the mathematical functions and algorithms for matrix calculations.

## Usage
